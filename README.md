# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Version 2.1.0 - Build with Deno's Fresh

I have decided to update my kinda recently updated website once again. Still using Deno, but just this time I am using the Fresh framework instead of Lume. It fits my application better I think and is cooler.

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
